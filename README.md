# MapleStory WSE Optimizer by Pearlite
### HTML Page: [pearlitic.github.io](https://pearlitic.github.io/)

Advanced options allows also optimizing for familiars and PDR. Please enter reasonable values, the calculator craps out otherwise. Optimizer assumes regular classes (max 6 lines of DMG%).

_To do: Sanitize inputs._

You can download the [source code folder](https://github.com/Pearlitic/pearlitic.github.io/releases) and open the index.html to run it offline (but I recommend using the Python version for better readablilty and customizability if you know how to set it up).

---

If you have a unique class that functions differently or want to customize the optimizer, download the Python script. It's much easier to customize and cleaner. The html/js code was written when I began learning coding and its a complete shitshow.

[Python version](https://github.com/Pearlitic/pearlitic.github.io/blob/main/Maple_WSE_Calculator.py) of this calculator for better editing and offline use. You can edit it and run it as a script if you have Python installed, or run it on an online IDE such as [\(online-python\)](https://www.online-python.com/). Requires Python 3.6+.
