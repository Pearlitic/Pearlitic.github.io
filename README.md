+ Familiar Potential List: [pearlitic.github.io/Familiar_Potential_List](https://pearlitic.github.io/Familiar_Potential_List)

Please enter reasonable values, the calculator craps out otherwise. Optimizer assumes 40% IED/DMG for Prime lines and 30% Boss/IED familairs.

You can download the [source code folder](https://github.com/Pearlitic/pearlitic.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and open the index.html to run it offline (but I recommend using the Python version for better readablilty and customizability if you know how to set it up).

### [Python Scripts](https://github.com/Pearlitic/pearlitic.github.io/tree/main/Python) for MapleStory

If you have a unique class that functions differently or want to customize the optimizer, download the Python script. It's much easier to customize and cleaner. There's also a version that supports custom familairs. The html/js code was written when I began learning coding and its a complete shitshow.

[Python version](https://github.com/Pearlitic/pearlitic.github.io/tree/main/Python) of this calculator for better editing and offline use. You can edit it and run it as a script if you have Python installed, or run it on an online IDE such as [\(online-python\)](https://www.online-python.com/). Requires Python 3.6+.
