## Stat Sources

Beware of some stats not calculated in the stats window.

"On Attack" stats aren't calculated until "on-hit", such as skill node bonus (+20% IED) on some skills, passive hyper skill that provides bonus to your active skill, and  active skill bonuses (e.g. Xenon's Snipe).

List of sources I can think of: 
+ Gear stat (not potential, the base stats e.g. CRA has 5% IED on the armor)
+ Gear set bonuses
+ Passive Skills
+ Buff Skills
+ Link Skills
+ Hyper Stat
+ Inner Ability
+ V Node Bonuses
+ Active Skill "on-hit" Bonus
+ Familiars (Can also be optimized with WSE, but if you only have a few good ones you can also treat them as "gear")
+ Soul
+ Consumables
