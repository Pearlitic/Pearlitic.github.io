## Stat Sources

Beware of some stats not calculated in the stats window.

"On-hit" stats aren't calculated until "on-hit", such as skill node bonus (+20% IED @Lv40) on some skills, passive Hyper skill that provides bonus to your active skill, and active skill 'conditional' bonuses (e.g. Xenon's Snipe). These stats are not shown in the stat window as they only apply to specific skills, but you should account for them if it is your main bossing skill. 

_Note that some skills come with something like "Passive: "+XX% some stat", these are actually treated liek passive skills and are included in the stat window. However, when in doubt, just ask in your class Discord channel!_

List of sources I can think of: 
+ Gear Stat (not potential, the base stats e.g. CRA has 5% IED on the armor)
+ Gear Set Bonuses
+ Passive Skills
+ Buff Skills
+ Link Skills
+ Hyper Stat
+ Inner Ability
+ V Node Bonuses
+ Active Skill "on-hit" Bonus
+ Familiars (Can also be optimized with WSE, but if you only have a few good ones you can also treat them as "gear")
+ Soul
+ Legion
+ Consumables

An easy and lazy way to find your IED and DMG is to equip a crap weapon with no potentials and use all your buffs. Use the values you get in the stat window as baseline, and then add the "on-hit" stats and other bonuses not accounted for in the stat window to your total.
